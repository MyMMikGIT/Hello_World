Meeting git hub for first time...

Hi there,

Trying out this thing called git hub, so far so good. Starting to uderstand its place in the world. Maybe it will be of use to me,
though I am the only one which will be using it for now. A bit scary that only public option of the projects is available, since
I am a bit unsecure about the code I write (is it legal to do what it does and is it not too simplictic for other more with coding realted persons to review). But it is interesting to use new things that make things better, at least eventually... Hopefully see you in the code...
